        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>Welcome to Fishy Chips Inc. For over 30 years, Fishy Chips Inc. has provided quality delicious coffee-time accoutrements to early risers across the globe. We pride ourselves in creating delectable, beautiful, uniquely tasting cookies and biscuits inspired by our founder, Spencer Lionel Richey. Spencer, or Lionel as his close friends knew him as, stumbled upon a delicious combination of boldly contrasting flavors during a fishing trip one sunny morning over 40 years ago. After reeling in and wrestling a massive 25 pound salmon in the Little Red River in central Arkansas, Lionel didn't notice that while fighting the monster trout, he knocked some of his bait into his coffee mug. Unaware, he took a large swig of his morning cup of Joe and noticed a peculiar taste in his coffee. Instead of dumping the coffee out, he just added sugar and cream to dilute the hint of bait in his coffee. And HE LIKED IT! After spending 10 years perfecting his recipe, he finally made a cookie that tasted just like his accidental creation: sweet, creamy, coffee taste with a hint of raw freshwater fishiness. Fishy Chips Inc was born, and quickly swept the world as the best tasting and certainly most unique morning-time cookie.  </p>
